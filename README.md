# Travel App

The **Travel App** allows users to plan routes from a starting location to a destination on a map, with the option to automatically set the starting location to the user's current location.

## Features

1. **Set Start and End Locations:**
   - Users can manually set the start and end locations using text fields.
   - Clicking on the map sets the start or end location depending on the edit mode.

2. **Automatic Start Location:**
   - Clicking the "Find Me" button sets the start location to the user's current location.
   - Users can overwrite this location if they change their mind.

3. **Transport Selection:**
   - Users can choose the mode of transport (car, walking, public transit) using buttons at the top of the screen.

4. **Calculate and Display Route:**
   - The app calculates the route between the chosen start and end locations and displays it on the map.
   - Users can choose from up to three routes (if available) based on the selected transport mode.

5. **Route Options:**
   - Users can view available route options by clicking the "Options" button.
